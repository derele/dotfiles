My emacs setup. This equals more or less my whole computing setup. 

I use only three programms:
- An emacs on my laptop (or whatever machine I am sitting at; for now only my laptop) 
- A web-browser called conkeror, which also runs on the local machine.
- A remote emacs on my ssh-server 

The goal of this setup is mainly to control the two local programms also from within the remote machine's emacs.
