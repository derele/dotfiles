;;; Commentary:
;;
;; Based on: TeXMed - http://www.bioinformatics.org/texmed/
;; an interface to NCBI PubMed http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov, 
;; that allows you to query PubMed and to store references in BibTeX format. 
;; by Arne Muller
;;
;; This mode adds some convenience functions to the w3m-buffers opened
;; searching on TexMed
;;
;; Installation:
;; 1). Download this file and put in your emacs's load-path
;; 2). Put the following in your .emacs:
;;     (require 'TeXMed)
;;     (global-set-key "\C-ct" 'TeXMed-search)
;;
;; Dependencies: 
;; 1). emacs-w3m http://emacs-w3m.namazu.org/ 
;;
;; Usage:
;; 1). Type C-ct (or whatever you bind it to) to start a query
;; 2). Presented with the results of the query you have these options:
;;     a) Type C-ea to export all results to a bibtex-file
;;     b) Type C-el to go through results and choose one by one
;;         + If you do this till the last entry your selection will be 
;;           exported automatically
;;         + If you are satisfied before the end abort with C-g an goto 3.)
;; 3). Type C-ee to export a selection
;; 4). To generally include abstracts or article links you can put the
;;     following into your .emacs:
;;     (setq  TeXMed-include-abstract t)
;;     (setq  TeXMed-include-article-id t)
;; 5). To set the folder in which TeXMed results are stored you can put
;;     (setq TeXMed-bibtex-folder "~/bibtex/")
;      in your .emacs (the default is your homedir)
;;
;; Only tested with Gnu-Emacs 23.1.1 on Linux.

;; This is my very first minor mode for Emacs: It probabely has bugs,
;; uses maybe bad elisp and fails following some of the conventions
